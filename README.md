# Mini-C-Language

Part 1: The Lexer (aka Scanner or Tokenizer)
The lexer transforms source text into tokens. The goal is to transform a program, represented
as a string, into a list of tokens that capture the different elements of the program.

Part 2: The Parser
The parser consists of three main functions which parse expressions, statements, and an entire
program (parse_expr, parse_stmt and parse_main.) The three functions work together
to parse a full program.
